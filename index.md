  I am a fourth year Ph.D. student at
  <a href="https://www.utexas.edu">The University of Texas at Austin</a> , <a href="https://stat.utexas.edu">Department of Statistics and Data Sciences</a>. I am fortunately to be supervised by
  <a href="https://mingyuanzhou.github.io">Prof. Mingyuan Zhou</a> and also work with   <a href="https://psarkar.github.io"> Prof. Purnamrita Sarkar </a>.  Before coming to UT, I spent four years as undergraduate in <a href="http://www.fudan.edu.cn/en/"> Fudan University</a> studying <a href="http://math.fudan.edu.cn/olden/Index.htm"> mathematics</a>.
  I am broadly interested in statistical machine learning and Bayesian methods. Some of my interests are 
  <p>
  <ul>
  <li> Approximate Bayes inference, eg. Variational Bayes and MCMC; </li>
  <li> Theoretical analysis of iterative algorithms, eg. EM, Variational inference, Gibbs sampling; </li>
  <li> Bayesian deep learning; </li>
  <li> Convex/Non-convex optimization; </li>
  <li> Reinforcement Learning </li>
  </ul>
