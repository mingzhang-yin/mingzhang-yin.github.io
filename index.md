 <p> I am an assistant professor in the <a href="https://warrington.ufl.edu/marketing-department"> Marketing Department</a> of the Warrington College of Business, the University of Florida.  I’m also an affiliate assistant professor in the <a href="https://stat.ufl.edu"> Department of Statistics</a>,  and an affiliated member in the UF <a href="https://ai.ufl.edu"> Artificial Intelligence Academic Initiative</a>.   </p> 
 

 
<p>  Previously, I was a postdoctoral scholar at the Data Science Institute, Columbia University, working with <a href="http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~blei/">Prof. David M. Blei</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_Tavaré">Prof. Simon Tavaré</a>. I received my Ph.D. in Statistics from the University of Texas at Austin, supervised by <a href="https://mingyuanzhou.github.io">Prof. Mingyuan Zhou</a>.  Before coming to UT, I spent four years as an undergraduate at the math department of  Fudan University, Shanghai. </p>

 
<p> My research focuses on the intersection of Bayesian statistics, machine learning, causal inference, and quantitative marketing. The topics I am interested in include </p>



  <ul>
   <li> <a href="https://mingzhang-yin.github.io/pubs/pml.html">Probabilistic machine learning</a>: deep generative model, meta-learning, conformal prediction, factor model</li>
   <li> <a href="https://mingzhang-yin.github.io/pubs/bayes.html">Bayesian inference and modeling</a>: variational inference, uncertainty estimation, discrete latent variable models </li>
   <li> <a href="https://mingzhang-yin.github.io/pubs/causal.html">Causal inference</a>: heterogeneous treatment effects, sensitivity analysis, quasi-experiments, fairness </li>
   <li> <a href="https://mingzhang-yin.github.io/index.html">Quantitative marketing</a>: customer analytics, online advertising, unstructured data analysis </li>
